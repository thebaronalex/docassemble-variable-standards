# docassemble-variable-standards
Repository aimed at creating and maintaining a standardized set of docassemble "variables" that take full advantage of the benefits of object oriented programming.

After Docacon 2019 it seemed like there was a need for having discussions on establishing a standardized set of "variables" that can be used in docassemble interviews and templates. My hope of establishing Having a list like this will allow front end creators to created a drop down list of commonly used variables.  

How will we structure these variables?
What syntax will we use when titling the variables?
How should we use the advantages of object oriented programing and the capabilities of docassemble to structure this in the most efficient way? 
Which will functions will be the most appropriate?
